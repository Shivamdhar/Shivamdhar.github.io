Traditionally, experts used email clients, database systems and text editors to perform this investigation. With the advent of technology, elaborate tools which summarize data more efficiently by using cutting edge data visualisation techniques have come out. Beagle is one such tool which visualises the large communication data using different panels such that the inspector has better chances of finding the scam network.</td></tr></table>"

This can lead to the spread of positive as well as negative elements in the network depending on the type and source of information. Given a piece of information, it becomes essential to understand how different people would react to it. The objective of this project is to build a topic-based language model for a tweet network. We predict the reply of a user to a tweet, based on their political inclinations - left or right.</td></tr></table>"

In the race of coming in limelight, few creators try to improve the statistics of published content like the number of views, subscribers, likes, etc. through automated scripts or bots. This is a concern for two reasons - a) inflated views lead to disparity among the genuine creators, gaining popularity via organic traffic and others resorting to bot inflation for fame, thus abusing the remuneration mechanism b) ad impressions which work only in case of user interactions like clicks, get wasted due to the activity of view bots, taking a toll on the youtube advertisers. Hence, it is important to solutionize the problem by analyzing the social media interactions and penalize the fake popularity seekers for violating the terms of service. This would also help businesses to get finer insights from their consumer base and not get misled by the popularity of certain content.</td></tr></table>"

Despite the empirical success of existing systems, spammers may continuously evolve over time to impersonate normal users while new types of spammers may also emerge to combat with the current detection system, leading to the fact that a built system will gradually lose its efficacy in spotting spammers. To address this issue, grounded on the contextual bandit model, we present a novel system for conducting interactive spammer detection. </td></tr></table>"
